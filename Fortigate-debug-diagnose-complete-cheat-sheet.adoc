= Fortigate debug and diagnose commands complete cheat sheet
:homepage: 
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc:




NOTE: To enable debug set by any of the commands below, you need to run
*diagnose debug enable*. This is assumed and not reminded any further. Use *dia
debug info* to know what debug is enabled, and at what level.

NOTE: To disable and stop immediately any debug, run *dia deb res* which is short for *diagnose debug reset*.

NOTE: All debug will run for 30 minutes by default, to increase use `diagnose debug duration <minutes>`, setting to 0 means unlimited by time. Reboot will reset this setting.







== Security rulebase debug (diagnose debug flow)
.Security rulebase diagnostics with `diagnose debug flow`
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose firewall iprope lookup <src IP> <src port> <dst IP> <dst port>
<IANA protocol number> <src interface>*
|Policy lookup for any combination of IPs and ports - use to see what policy (if
any) matches traffic between specific IP addresses and ports. E.g. `dia firewall
iprope lookup 10.10.10.1 34567 8.8.8.8 443 6 LAN1`

|*diagnose debug flow filter*
|Show the active filter for the flow debug

|*diagnose debug filter clear*
|Remove any filtering of the debug output set

|*diagnose debug flow filter <filtering param> / dia debug flow filter6 <param>*
| Set filter for security rulebase processing packets output. You can set multiple filters - act as AND, by issuing this command multiple times. Parameters:

`vd` - id number of the vdom. When entering the vdom with `edit vdom`, this number is shown first.

`vd-name` - limit debug to specific VDOM by its name. Fortigate translates the name to VDOM ID (`vd`).

`proto` - Protocol number.

`addr` - IP address of the packet(s), be it a destination or/and a source.

`saddr` - IP source address of the packet(s).

`daddr` - IP destination address of the packet(s).

`port` - Source or/and destination port in the packet(s).

`sport` - Source port of the packet(s).

`dport` - Destination port of the packet(s).

`negate <parameter>` - negate the match, i.e. match if a packet does NOT contain  `<parameter`. Where `parameter` is one of the above: `vd`, `addr`, `saddr`, `port`, `sport`, `dport`

|*diagnose debug filter6 <parameter>*
| Same as `diagnose debug filter` but for IPv6 packets. The rest of matching and conditions remain of the same syntax.

|*diagnose debug flow show function-name enable*
|Show function names responsible for each step in processing.

|*diagnose debug flow trace start [number]*
|Actually start the debug with optional `number` to limit number of packets traced. 

|*diagnose debug flow trace start6 [number]*
|Start the debug trace for IPv6 traffic, with optional `number` to limit number of packets traced.

== Packet Sniffer (diagnose sniffer packet)

[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*dia sni pa _if-name_/any 'tcpdump syntax filter' _verbosity_ _count_
_time-format_*
a| Network level packet sniffer like tcpdump/tshark/wireshark, presenting captured
packets on CLI. It gives definite answers whether a packet reached the
Fortigate, whether it was dropped by firewall rules, what was incoming/outgoing
interface, and contents of the packet if needed.

`verbosity` - level of detail to present, can be one of:

1 - packets' header, includes IP addresses, ports, and flags if set.

2 - packets' header and data for IP packet, i.e. same as above plus contents of
the packet.

3 - same as 2 above plus Ethernet header.

4 - packets' header (no contents) plus incoming/outgoing interface name for each
packet. This gives the indication whether the packet passed the Fortigate or was
dropped by it.

5 - same data as `4` plus contents of IP packets.

6 - packets' header starting from Ethernet plus contents and incoming/outgoing
interface names.


`count` - number of packets to capture, integer. If not set, will be capturing
until the SSH/console timeout or until stopped with `CTRL + C`.

`time-format`:

* `a` - absolute UTC time
* `l` - local time
* _default_ - relative to the start of sniffing in seconds.milliseconds.

|_IPv6_
|For IPv6 traffic, the command is the same, but use the relevant `filter` clauses instead, 
e.g. `host 2001:db8::1` or `net 2001:db8::/64` or `icmp6`.

|*set auto-asic-offload disable*
|You may need to temporarily disable NPU hardware acceleration offloading, to see accelerated packets. You do so inside a specific firewall policy. This will cause all packets passing on this policy rule to be processed by CPU and thus make packets visible to the sniffer. This may increase the CPU load. E.g. `config firewall policy`, `edit 1`, `set auto-asic-offload disable`. Do not forget to turn it on again: `set auto-asic-offload enable`.

|*diagnose sys ha checksum recalculate*
|Force cluster member to recalculate checksums, often will solve the out of sync problem. No adverse effects. Run on each cluster member. 

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global>*
|Print detailed synchronization status for each configuration part. Use after seeing `out-of-sync` in *diagnose sys ha checksum cluster* to know which part of configuration causes members to be out-of-sync. Need to run on each cluster member and compare, long output - use `diff`/`vimdiff/Notepad++ Compare plugin` to spot the differences.

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global> <settings part name>*
|Show exact setting inside the settings tree that causes out-of-sync. Use output from *diagnose sys ha checksum show* (see above) for _settings part name_.

|*diagnose debug app hatalk -1*
|Enable heartbeat communications debug. It shows in real time if members are talking over sync interfaces. 
The output will look like `state/chg_time/now=2(work)/1610773657/1617606630`, where the desired `state` is _work_, _chg\_time_ is last cluster state/failover date in epoch, and _now_ is the last time communication occurred on heartbeat interface(s), also in epoch. 

|*diag debug application hasync -1* 
|Real time synchronization between members. As only things that changed get synchronized after 1st sync is established, may take time to produce output. See next.

|*execute ha synchronize stop*

*diag debug enable*

*diag debug application hasync -1*

*execute ha synchronize start*

|Stop, enable debug, then start again HA synchronization process, will produce lots of output.


|*exe ha manage ?*

*exe ha manage <id>*

|First show index of all Fortigate cluster members, then enter any secondary member CLI via its index.


|*diagnose sys ha reset-uptime*
a| Resets uptime of this member making it less than the other member(s)'s uptime
and so fails over to those member(s). This is a temporary way to force cluster
fail-over to another member from the current one. NOTE: check that the setting
below is present or immediately after the reset and failover, this member will become
active again if it has higher HA priority.

|List logged in users the Fortigate learned via FSSO

|*diagnose debug authd fsso server-status*
| Show status of connections with FSSO servers. Note: it shows both, local and remote FSSO Agent(s). The local Agent is only relevant when using Direct DC Polling, without installing FSSO Agent on AD DC, so it is ok for it to be `waiting for retry ... 127.0.0.1` if you don't use it. The working state should be `connected`.

== SIP ALG and helper
.SIP proxy or helper debug
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*config sys settings*

*get \| grep alg*

|Show the current SIP inspection mode. If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: proxy-based` then the full Layer 7 
proxy SIP inspection is on (_ALG_ inspection). If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: kernel-helper-based` then the Layer 4 _helper_ inspection is on. In both modes Fortigate does IP address translation inside SIP packets (if needed), and opens dynamically high ports for incoming media/voice streams ports. In _ALG_ mode, the Fortigate additionally does RFC compliance verification and more. So, the _ALG_ mode is more prone to cause issues but also provides more security.

|*show system session-helper \| grep sip -f*
|If using SIP _helper_ and not _ALG_, make sure there is an entry for SIP in the helpers list, usually on port 5060, but may be custom as well. 


|*diagnose debug application sip -1*

 time window (3 days default), the token needs to be re-provisioned to a user again.

`locked` - token was locked either manually by administrator, or because
Fortigate was not able to reach Fortiguard servers. 


|*exec ping fds1.fortinet.com*

[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*fnsysctl ifconfig [int-name]*
|Show detailed information on all/specific interface - errors, MTU, and more.

|*fnsysctl ls [path]*
|List files/folders in the filesystem. Useful for post-incident investigation of Fortigate compromises, looking for a given CVE indicators of compromise (IOCs).

|*fnsysctl cat <filename>*
| Show contents of a file, not all files in the filesystem are accessible. Some examples: 

* Show Linux kernel version of the Fortigate: 
`fnsysctl cat /proc/version`

* Show open TCP connections to/from Fortigate itself (use `diagnose sys tcpsock \| grep 0.0.0.0` instead):
`fnsysctl cat /proc/net/tcp`

* Show CPU info: `fnsysctl cat /proc/cpuinfo` 

* Get memory information: `fnsysctl cat /proc/meminfo` 

|*fnsysctl date*
| Show date in the Linux format, ignores any options.

|*fnsysctl df -h*
|Show filesystem usage, useful when you have harddisk(s) attached to the Fortigate.

|*fnsysctl du*
|Show directories usage, accepts following options:

`-d n` - Limit depth to n levels deep.

`-a` - Show/count files as well, not only directories.

`-s` - Show only the summary usage of all directories/files.

`-L` - Follow all symlinks

|*fnsysctl pwd*
|Show current working directory. Not very useful as we don’t have access to `cd` and thus cannot change directory anyway.

|*fnsysctl ps*
|List running processes. Useful together with the next command `kill`` for restarting some stuck process on Fortigate. Most of the processes in Fortigate are run via Watch Dog which means killing them will shut the running process and will restart it immediately later.

|*fnsysctl kill <process-id>*
|Kill a process by its ID (PID). The only option accepted is `-s N` where N is the signal number to send as per Linux.

|*fnsysctl killall <process-name>*
|Kill/restart a process by name. When using `killall` it is not recorded in the crash log file (which you read with `diagnose debug crashlog read`). Not all processes can be killed with it, e.g. hasync.

|*fnsysctl mv <src> <dst>*
|Move file in the filesystem. Most of the directories on the Fortigate are read-only, but some, like tmp are not. This command will ask for the adminstrator username/password explicitly. 

|*fnsysctl printenv*
|Print environment variables. The only environment variable I was able to catch with this was type of Terminal used.

|*fnsysctl grep <regex> <file>*
|Search contents of a file/files. The usual grep options are available:

        -i      Ignore case distinctions

        -l      List names of files that match
        
        -H      Prefix output lines with filename where match was found
        
        -h      Suppress the prefixing filename on output
        
        -n      Print line number with output lines
        
        -q      Quiet
        
        -v      Select non-matching lines
        
        -s      Suppress file open/read error messages
        
        -c      Only print count of matching lines
        
        -A      Print NUM lines of trailing context
        
        -B      Print NUM lines of leading context
        
        -C      Print NUM lines of output context
